Run SCUBA* notebook to produce results files and master catalogues

Then we need to run best_plotting* to get the InfoFiles

Then run "run_summarise*" to plot the rainbow plots by different source sets
like leaving out CRL 618 or not

Currently, run_summarise calls plot_by_tauxam.py and that is what
produces these plots by source set. This code (plot_by_tauxam)
prints out information that I have been manually copying and pasting
to plot_FCFs_by_time_of_night* to create the rainbow plots that show
before and after epochs for all, SS, EO. 

Things I need to do imminently: Move best_plotting* to here and
fix it up so it cleanly produces those InfoFiles - choose what plots
it should make every time and fix the x axis limits on it to be inputs

Then, fix plot_FCFs_by_time_of_night so it takes inputs and fix
plot_by_tauxam to produce those correct inputs - this means we need
to run both constrained and not constrained togther.

Then fix run_summarise to print out proper latex tables

Then make the Jupyter notebook run this whole analysis with nothing
else in the way.
