# Beginning With Raw Calibrator Data: Derive the SCUBA-2 FCFs

This jupyter notebook:

`SCUBA2_FCFs.ipynb`

along with all of its associated programs and configuration files illustrates and summarises the compilation of
some of the more important codes and I have been writing to analyse SCUBA-2 FCF data.

Here is a basic summary of what this work entails:

1. Finding Physical Opacity Relations to Test
1. Finding the Optimal Opacity Relation for each wavelength out of that physical set
1. Measuring the Peak and Arcsec FCFs for each wavelength (all data)
1. Applying sensible constraints to the data and recognising different times of night/weather make differences
1. Looking at the data taken while the membrane was removed
1. Comparing the pre-membrane-removal and post-membrane-replacement data 
1. Looking at other metrics such as beam size/shape

There is further information in the jupyter notebook along with example plots.
