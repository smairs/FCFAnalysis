    "Now, you can use this list of results directories along with the printed output of the TauRelResults() function (namely, the optimal, or, \"best\" dictionary keys), above, to change the find_outliers() input manually, or just use the automated results depending on what you want to look at. Also, you can play with the constraints and look at all the output images to identify the most optimal constraints to use! Information will be printed about the Beam_FWHM for each source and the sources together (if multiple sources are being analysed). The first plots show all identify outliers in the FCF versus MJD plots and colour those points differently in histograms of source properties so it is easy to see if certain properties (high airmass, low air temperature) bias the results. The final plots show the FCFs as a function of MJD and as a function of transmission and a printout of the FCF for each source in each epoch.\n",

    "The identify_outliers_find_FCFs_make_catalogue code also produces a topcat readable catalogue of all the measured, calculated, and metadata values so you can plot any parameter against any other parameter."
